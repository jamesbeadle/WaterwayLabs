    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold my-4">System Architecture</h1>

    <p class="my-2">
      OpenFPL is being built as a progressive web application, it's curernt
      frontend is React but will be moved over to Svelte for the start of 2024.
      The OpenFPL backend is developed in Motoko. The Github is publicly
      available at github.com/jamesbeadle/openfpl. OpenFPL's architecture is
      designed for scalability and efficiency, ensuring robust performance even
      as user numbers grow. Here's how the system is structured:
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4">Profile Data</h2>
    <p class="my-2">
      OpenFPL allocates approximately 254 bytes for a profile record. This means
      that a single Profile Canister could hold more than 16m profiles, scaling
      to a size larger than the market leader.
    </p>
    <p class="my-2">
      Each profile record will hold a reference to the Profile Picture canister
      where their pfp is stored. We limit the size of profile pictures to 500KB,
      meaning you can store 8,000 images per Profile Picture canister. When the
      canister is full, a new Profile Picture canister is created to store the
      images.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4">Fantasy Teams Data</h2>
    <p class="my-2">
      OpenFPL allocates approximately 913 KB for a fantasy team with a lifetime
      of seasons history. Therefore we can store over 4,000 fantasy teams in
      each canister. When this limit is reached, a new canister is created. A
      reference to the userâ€™s Fantasy Team canister is stored in the user
      profile record.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4">Leaderboard Data</h2>
    <p class="my-2">
      The size of the leaderboard data is very much dependent on the number of
      users on the site as each will create an entry in each leaderboard.
      Therefore we will create a new canister for each leaderboard. For each
      season there will be a Season Leaderboard canister, 38 Gameweek
      Leaderboard canisters and 12 Monthly Leaderboard canisters. This
      architecture will scale to 25m+ users, more than double the players of the
      market leading platform.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4">
      Main Canister & Central Data Management
    </h2>
    <p class="my-2">
      Our system estimates the size of the main canister containing data for 100
      seasons as around 44MB. With around 1% of the 4GB canister being used,
      substantial room is available for additional growth and functionalities.
      The Main canister will contain the following key pieces of information:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc ml-4">
      <li>Data Cache Hashes</li>
      <li>Teams Data</li>
      <li>Seasons Data</li>
      <li>Canister References</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4">Player Canisters</h2>
    <p class="my-2">
      The player canisters container information on all Premier League football
      players. OpenFPL allocates approximately 30 KB for each Player record.
      With a single canister on the Internet Computer boasting a 4GB capacity,
      it will be able to store 100.000+ Premier League player entries. Each
      Premier League team could theoretically introduce up to 50 new players per
      team annually. However, this number implies a complete change of a team's
      squad, an eventuality that's exceedingly uncommon in the Premier League.
      Therefore, our projection of 1,000 new players across the league each year
      offers a deliberately conservative overestimation. Given these
      calculations, the following 3 canisters will be able to manage all the
      Premier League players for well over 100 years:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc ml-4">
      <li>Live Players Canister</li>
      <li>Former Players Canister</li>
      <li>Retired Players Canister</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="my-2">
      Players will move from the live canister to and from the Former or Retired
      players canister when required.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4">Cycle Dispenser</h2>
    <p class="my-2">
      The cycle dispenser canister watches each canister in the OpenFPL
      ecosystem and tops it up with cycles when it reaches 20% of its top up
      value.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4">
      Note on Architecture Evolution and Whitepaper Updates
    </h2>
    <p class="my-2">
      As OpenFPL progresses through the SNS testflight phase, our architecture
      may undergo changes to optimize performance and scalability. We are
      committed to staying at the forefront of technological advancements,
      ensuring that our platform remains robust and efficient.
    </p>
    <p class="my-2">
      To keep our community and stakeholders informed, any significant changes
      to the architecture will be reflected in updated versions of this
      whitepaper. Each new version will be clearly marked to ensure transparency
      and ease of reference, maintaining our commitment to openness and
      communication with our users.
