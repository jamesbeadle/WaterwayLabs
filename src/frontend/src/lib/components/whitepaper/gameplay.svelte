    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold">OpenFPL Gameplay</h1>
    <p class="my-4">
      At OpenFPL, our gameplay rules are designed to create an immersive,
      engaging, and unique fantasy football experience. We understand the
      passion and strategy that goes into fantasy football, and our gameplay
      rules are crafted to reflect this, enhancing the fun and competitiveness
      of each gameweek.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold">Starting Funds and Team Composition</h2>
    <p class="my-2">
      Each user begins their journey with £300m, a budget to strategically build
      their dream team. The value of players fluctuates based on community
      ratings within the DAO. If a player's performance garners enough votes,
      their value can either increase or decrease by £0.25m each gameweek.
    </p>
    <p class="my-2">
      In terms of team structure, each user's team consists of 11 players.
      Picking from a range of clubs is key, so a maximum of two players from any
      single club can be selected. Teams must adhere to a valid formation: 1
      goalkeeper, 3-5 defenders, 3-5 midfielders, and 1-3 strikers.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4">Transfers and Team Management</h2>
    <p class="my-2">
      Flexibility is a cornerstone of our gameplay. Users can make up to three
      transfers per week, allowing for dynamic team management and adaptation to
      the ever-changing football landscape. These transfers don't roll over,
      encouraging active participation each week. There are no substitutes in
      our game, eliminating the frustration of unused bench points.
    </p>
    <p class="my-2">
      Each January, users can overhaul their team completely once, adding
      another strategic layer to the game reflecting the January transfer
      window.
    </p>
