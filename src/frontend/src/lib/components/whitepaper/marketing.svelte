    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Online Marketing Strategy</h2>
    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold">
      Collaboration with Digitial Marketing Agency
    </h2>
    <p class="my-2">
      We are engaging with a digital marketing agency known for their experience
      working with startups in the digital space. This agency is in the process
      of finalising plans for a comprehensive online marketing campaign. The
      campaign will focus on PPC (Pay-Per-Click) and SEO (Search Engine
      Optimisation) strategies, with an emphasis on reaching specific user
      groups effectively.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4">Initial Strategy and Goals</h2>
    <p class="my-2">
      We will have a particular focus on the UK market for initial traction.
      Tracking success through KPIs, focusing on manager sign-ups and event
      attendance.

    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4">OpenFPL's Initiatives</h2>
    <p class="my-2">
      Our approach is to seamlessly integrate OpenFPL's online marketing
      campaigns with our broader initiatives. A key focus will be on targeted
      local advertising, aiming to highlight the distribution of 200 junior
      football club kits to grassroots football causes across the UK.
      Additionally, we've created a return on investment (ROI) leaderboard for
      each of our NFT collections. This leaderboard will highlight and market
      the clubs that are the most active and supportive in our network. The aim
      is to boost purchases through the ICPFA shop.

    <p class="my-2">
      In November 2023, a proposal was passed in the OpenChat DAO for them to
      become the official sponsor of OpenFPL. They will appear on our pick team
      advertising boards along with the football apparel given to grassroots
      football causes and sold through the ICPFA shop. We feel this partnership
      is important as promoting the wide arrange of apps available on the IC
      ecosytem will increase the pace at which the world adopts Internet
      Computer services.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4">Future Considerations</h2>
    <p class="my-2">
      Outside of traditional digital marketing we plan to explore additional
      areas, such as influencer marketing.

    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">In-Person Event Marketing Strategy</h2>
    <p class="my-2">
      As part of our comprehensive marketing plan, OpenFPL is preparing to
      launch a series of in-person, interactive events in cities home to Premier
      League clubs. These events, expected to start from Q2 2024, are inspired
      by the successful engagement strategies of major UK brands like IBM, Ford
      and Coca-Cola.

      event management professionals to assist in creating immersive event
      experiences. We will utilise the expertise of OpenFPL founder, James
      Beadle, in developing and delivering these interactive experiences.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4">Event Objectives and Content</h2>
    <p class="my-2">
      We would like to teach attendees about OpenFPL and the broader Internet
      Computer ecosystem, including Internet Identity and a variety of IC dApps.
      Facilitating hands-on interactions and demonstrations will provide a
      deeper understanding of OpenFPL's features and benefits.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4">Promotion and Community Engagement</h2>
    <p class="my-2">
      We plan to promote these events through targeted local advertising, social
      media campaigns, and collaborations with local football clubs and
      communities. We will encouraging participants to share their experiences
      on social media through various reward scheme, amplifying our reach and
      impact.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4">Long-Term Vision</h2>
    <p class="my-2">
      We will be exploring opportunities to replicate this event model in other
      regions, expanding OpenFPL's global footprint.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4">Overall Approach</h2>
    <p class="my-2">
