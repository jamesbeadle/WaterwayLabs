    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold">OpenFPL Revenue Streams</h1>
    <p class="my-4">
      OpenFPL's revenue model is thoughtfully designed to sustain and grow the
      DAO while ensuring practical utility and value for its users.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold">Diversified Revenue Model</h2>
    <p class="my-2">
      To avoid creating a supply shock by pegging services to a fixed token
      amount, OpenFPL's revenue streams are diversified. This approach mitigates
      the risk of reduced service usage due to infeasibility, ensuring long-term
      stability and utility.
    </p>
    <p class="my-2">
      Revenue streams include Private Leagues, Site Sponsorship, Content
      Creators, Podcasts, and Merchandise. These channels provide a balanced mix
      of $FPL and $ICP revenue, enhancing the DAO's financial resilience.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4">Private Leagues</h2>
    <p class="my-2">
      Private league fees in OpenFPL are charged in ICP to establish a stable
      revenue base. This approach aligns the revenue directly with the number of
      managers, ensuring it scales with user engagement.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4">Merchandise</h2>
    <p class="my-2">
      We have setup a shop at <a
        class="text-blue-500"
        href="https://icpga.org/shop">icpfa.org/shop</a
      > where you will be able to purchase OpenFPL merchandise in FPL or ICP. All
      profits after the promotion, marketing and production of this merchandise will
      be deposited into the DAO's treasury.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">Podcasts</h2>
    <p class="my-2">
      OpenFPL is expanding into podcasting with a main podcast and then various
      club-specific satellite podcasts. Initially hosted off-chain, our
      long-term goal is to transition these to on-chain hosting as services
      become available.
    </p>
    <p class="my-2">
      The main podcast will cover general OpenFPL and football topics, while the
      satellite podcasts will target fans of specific clubs.
    </p>
    <p class="my-2">
      Revenue will be generated from sponsorships and advertising. As our
      listener base grows, these podcasts are expected to become increasingly
      lucrative. All profits, after production costs, will be deposited into the
      DAO's treasury. Beyond revenue, these podcasts are a strategic move to
      bolster community engagement and enhance the OpenFPL brand, providing
      valuable content to our audience.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4">Site Sponsorship</h2>
    <p class="my-2">
      Starting from August 2025, following the conclusion of the sponsorship
      deal with OpenChat, OpenFPL will offer the site sponsorship rights for
      bidding through the DAO. This will open opportunities for interested
      parties to become the named sponsor for an entire season.
    </p>
    <p class="my-2">
      Each year, sponsors can submit their bids to become the main site sponsor
      for the upcoming season, offering any ICRC-1 currency. Once a sponsor is
      selected, their exclusive rights will be secure for the entirety of that
      season. The DAO will not allow further proposals for site sponsorship
      until the subsequent preseason, ensuring the sponsor's exclusive
      visibility and association with OpenFPL.
    </p>
    <p class="my-2">
      All sponsorship revenue will be directed into the DAO's treasury,
      contributing to the financial health and sustainability of OpenFPL.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4">Content Creators</h2>
    <p class="my-2">
      OpenFPL will create a platform for content creators that is designed to
      both empower creators and enhance the utility of the FPL token. Creators
      will produce fantasy football-related content and share it on OpenFPL.
      This content will be available through a video reel format accessible to
      all users.
    </p>
    <p class="my-2">
      For general reel content, creators earn from a pool of FPL tokens,
      allocated based on user likes. Creators can also offer exclusive content
      for subscribers. They will receive 95% of the FPL tokens from these
      subscriptions.
    </p>
    <p class="my-2">
      Subscriptions are purchased exclusively with FPL tokens, enhancing their
      utility. The remaining 5% from subscriptions remains in the DAO's
      treasury. This approach aligns with OpenFPL's commitment to supporting
      content creators, increasing FPL token utility, and rewarding its
      community of neuron holders.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4">Revenue Redistribution Plan</h2>
    <p class="my-2">
      In line with our commitment to directly benefit neuron holders, OpenFPL
      will allocate 50% of any ICRC-1 token received by the DAO each month to
      neuron holders.
    </p>
    <p class="my-2">
      Distribution to neuron holders will be proportional to each neuron's total
      $FPL value and its remaining duration. This ensures a fair and equitable
      redistribution of revenue.
    </p>
    <p class="my-2">
      Calculation for this distribution will be based on the status of FPL
      neurons as at the end of each month, aligning with the DAO's transparent
      and community-focused ethos.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4">Overall Revenue Philosophy</h2>
    <p class="my-2">
      OpenFPLâ€™s revenue philosophy is rooted in creating a sustainable ecosystem
      where the utility token maintains its value and relevance.
    </p>
    <p class="my-2">
      The reinvestment of revenues into the DAO and direct distribution to
      neuron holders are designed to foster a cycle of growth, user engagement,
      and shared prosperity.
