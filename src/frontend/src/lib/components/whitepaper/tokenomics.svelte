    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold my-4">$FPL Utility Token</h1>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">Utility and Functionality</h2>
    <p class="my-2">
      OpenFPL will be revenue generating, the most important role of the Utility
      token is to manage the OpenFPL treasury. The token is also used throughout
      the OpenFPL ecosystem:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc ml-4">
      <li>
        Rewarding users for gameplay achievements on weekly, monthly, and annual
        bases.
      </li>
      <li>
        Facilitating participation in DAO governance, like raising proposals for
        player revaluation and team detail updates.
      </li>
      <li>Rewarding neuron holders upon maturity.</li>
      <li>Accepting bids for season site sponsorship from organisations.</li>
      <li>
        Used for customisable entry fee (along with any ICRC-1 token)
        requirements for private leagues.
      </li>
      <li>Purchase of Merchandise from the ICPFA shop.</li>
      <li>Reward content creators for engagement on a football video reel.</li>
      <li>
        Facilitate subscriptions to access premium football content from
        creators.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4">Genesis Token Allocation</h2>
    <p class="my-2">
      At the outset, OpenFPL's token allocation will be as follows:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc ml-4">
      <li>ICPFA: 12%</li>
      <li>Funded NFT Holders: 12%</li>
      <li>SNS Decentralisation Sale: 25%</li>
      <li>DAO Treasury: 51%</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="my-2">
      The ICPFA team members will receive their $FPL within 5 baskets of equal
      neurons. The neurons will contain the following configuration:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc ml-4">
      <li>Basket 1: Locked for 3 months with a 3 month dissolve delay.</li>
      <li>Basket 2: Locked for 6 months with a 3 month dissolve delay.</li>
      <li>Basket 3: Locked for 12 months with a 3 month dissolve delay.</li>
      <li>Basket 4: Locked for 18 months with a 3 month dissolve delay.</li>
      <li>Basket 5: Locked for 24 months with a 3 month dissolve delay.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="my-2">
      Each Funded NFT holder will receive their $FPL within 5 baskets of equal
      neurons. The neurons will contain the following configuration:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc ml-4">
      <li>Basket 1: Unlocked with a dissolve delay of 30 days.</li>
      <li>Basket 2: Locked for 6 months with a 1 month dissolve delay.</li>
      <li>Basket 3: Locked for 12 months with a 1 month dissolve delay.</li>
      <li>Basket 4: Locked for 18 months with a 1 month dissolve delay.</li>
      <li>Basket 5: Locked for 24 months with a 1 month dissolve delay.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="my-2">
      Each SNS decentralisation swap participant will receive their $FPL within
      5 baskets of equal neurons. The neurons will contain the following
      configuration:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc ml-4">
      <li>Basket 1: Unlocked with zero dissolve delay.</li>
      <li>Basket 2: Unlocked with 3 months dissolve delay.</li>
      <li>Basket 3: Unlocked with 6 months dissolve delay.</li>
      <li>Basket 4: Unlocked with 9 months dissolve delay.</li>
      <li>Basket 5: Unlocked with 12 months dissolve delay.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4">DAO Valuation</h2>
    <p class="my-2">
      We have used the discounted cashflow method to value the DAO. The
      following assumptions have been made:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc ml-4">
      <li>We can grow to the size of our Web2 competitor over 8 years.</li>
      <li>Assumed 10% user conversion, each setting up a league at 1 ICP.</li>
      <li>
        Estimated 5% user content subscription rate at 5 ICP/month with 5% of
        this revenue going to the DAO.
      </li>
      <li>Estimated 5% users spend 10ICP per year.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4">Mitigation against a 51% Attack</h2>
    <p class="my-2">
      There is a danger that the OpenFPL SNS treasury could be the target of an
      attack. One possible scenario is for an attacker to buy a large proportion
      of the FPL tokens in the decentralisation sale and immediately increase
      the dissolve delay of all of their neurons to the maximum 4 year in an
      attempt to gain more than 50% of the SNS voting power. If successful they
      could force through a proposal to transfer the entire ICP and FPL treasury
      to themselves. The Community Fund actually provides a great deal of
      mitigation against this scenario because it limits the proportion of
      voting power an attacker would be able to acquire.
    </p>
    <p class="my-2">
      The amount raised in the decentralisation will be used as follows:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc ml-4">
      <li>
        80% will be staked in an 8 year neuron with the maturity interest paid
        to the ICPFA.
      </li>
      <li>
        10% will be available for exchange liquidity to enable trading of the
        FPL token.
      </li>
      <li>
        5% will be paid directly to the ICPFA after the decentralisation sale.
      </li>
      <li>
        5% will be held in reserve for cycles to run OpenFPL, likely to be
        unused as OpenFPL begins generating revenue.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="my-2">
      This treasury balance will be topped up with the DAO's revenue, with 50%
      being paid to neuron holders. Any excess balance can be utilised where the
      DAO sees fit.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4">Tokenomics</h2>
    <p class="my-2">
      Each season, 2.5% of the total $FPL supply will be minted for DAO rewards.
      There is no mechanism to automatically burn $FPL as we anticipate the user
      growth to be faster than the supply increase, thus increasing the price of
      $FPL. However a proposal can always be made to burn $FPL if required. If
      the DAO’s treasury is ever 60% or more of the total supply of $FPL, it
      will be ICP FA policy to raise a proposal to burn 5% of the total supply
      from the DAO’s treasury.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4">ICP FA Overview</h2>
    <p class="my-2">
      Managed by founder James Beadle, the ICP FA oversees the development,

      the ICP FA Community Fund, supporting grassroots football projects.
    </p>

    <p class="my-2">
      The ICPFA will receive 5% of the decentralisation sale along with the
      maturity interest from the staked neuron. These funds will be use for the
      following:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc ml-4">
      <li>
        The ongoing promotion and marketing of OpenFPL both online and offline.
